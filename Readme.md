# TODO

- [ ] provide methods for direct creation of NOT, OR, AND, etc operations (do not use CreateXXXOperation methods)
- [x] arrays of conditions and actions should not allow to modify its contents
- [ ] get rid of IAgent and use AIController (?)
- [ ] decide what to do when several actions are ranked the same
- [ ] is there a way to remove condition class and use predicate/expression class instead?
- [ ] add AsAIController() to IAgent
