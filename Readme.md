# TODO

- [ ] provide methods for direct creation of NOT, OR, AND, etc operations (do not use CreateXXXOperation methods)
- [x] arrays of conditions and actions should not allow to modify its contents
- [x] is there a way to remove condition class and use predicate/expression class instead?
- [x] add AsAIController() to IAgent
- [ ] replace all usings of 0.0 and 1.0 with constants from UtilityAIConstants
- [ ] mark methods and classes "final" where possible
- [ ] check UPROPERTY macros with EditAnywhere/VisibleAnywhere and replace in with more strict specifiers
- [ ] add logging (with custom categories)
- [ ] multioperations can get invalid number of arguments - fix

## Propositions

- [ ] add "cut out" value - if there is no action rated below given limit, agent does nothing
- [ ] add "DoNothing" action
- [ ] add AlwaysTrue and AlwaysFalse predicates (for testing purposes?)
